✨  Thanks for @fettrecon for this craft !

**Corpse crafting to have *triple* fractured resistances for ward boots**

This craft does not take into account the usage of bonus corpses (i.e. "increased effect of corpses in this grave row"). You can use these bonus corpses to make it cheaper, but I'll leave that to you, it's not super complicated.

The following recipe only uses `78/88` corpses for a **96%** chance of success, so you can add some more corpses if needed !

Once the item is crafted with all three fractured resistances, use dense fossils spam for tier 1 ward flat ward + tier 1 increased ward. 
Finally bench craft movespeed with onslaught (or chill immunity).

Corpse list :
```
20 x 500% increased resistance -> 10000% total

2 x 300% scarcer defences -> 600% total
2 x 300% scarcer mana -> 600% total
4 x 150% scarcer attack -> 600% total
5 x 300% scarcer chaos -> 1500% total
4 x 300% scarcer life -> 1200% total
1 x 300% scarcer physical -> 300% total
4 x 300% scarcer attribute -> 1200% total

14 x +50 modifier tier rating -> +700 total
1 x -1 explicit modifier -> -1 total

12 x 25% chance to fracture -> 300%
1 x increased suffix modifers -> 300%
6 x +5% quality -> 30% total
1 x +1 to item level
1 x creates a helmet, gloves or boots with ward

{2~3} x randomises the numeric values of base defences on an armour 6 times
```

⚠️ ONLY BUY ILVL 83 CORPSES
YOU CAN BUY LOWER ILVL CORPSES, BUT MAKE SURE TO ADD MORE "+1 to item level" TO REACH ILVL 84

**__Corpse crafting full T1 movement speed, T1 lightning resistance, 60-75% shock avoidance fractured ward boots__**

Finish by dense fossil spamming for T1 ward prefixes, and then maybe lock prefixes and veiled orb for a suffix (ailment effect is nice for brittle)!
